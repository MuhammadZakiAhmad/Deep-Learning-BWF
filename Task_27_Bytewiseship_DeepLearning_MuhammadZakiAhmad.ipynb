        "\n",
        "When stacking up layers in a neural network (ANN), it refers to the process of adding multiple layers to the network architecture. Each layer in the network receives input from the previous layer and passes its output to the next layer. By stacking layers, the network can learn increasingly complex representations of the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of layering is to enable the network to capture and extract hierarchical features and patterns from the data. The lower layers in the network tend to learn low-level features, while the higher layers learn more abstract and high-level representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of stacking layers in a neural network architecture is essential for achieving better performance and modeling capabilities. However, it's important to strike a balance. Too few layers may result in the network being unable to capture complex relationships, while too many layers can lead to overfitting, where the network performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, stacking up layers in a neural network refers to the process of adding multiple layers to the architecture, allowing the network to learn hierarchical representations and extract increasingly complex features from the input data."
